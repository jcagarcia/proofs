= Spring Roo sample application

This is a simple Spring Boot application generated with the Spring Roo development tool. The main difference with the common generated Spring Roo applications is that I applied the `push-in` command to all the classes to remove the `.aj` files so now, this application looks like a simple Spring Boot application.
